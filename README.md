- Colors and random tweaks.

## 8.9.2022

- Adding screencaptures of my pages.

## 12.9.2022

- Build prosess have been broken. Have updated packets - preview works. Uploading to Railway for public existense.

 ## 13.9.2022
 
 - Note to my self: In astro conf put server flag **host:true** so it will be published. Free money runs in Railway now and I you can't see the page, watch the picture. But it have been up :) https://my-astro-pages-v2-production.up.railway.app/

 - I move to next project and propably have new layout. Or if.... if I dockerise this and put it to my own server?
